# Chillar: My Personal Expense Tracker ðŸ›’ðŸ’¸

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  

This is **Chillar**, my little attempt to make tracking personal expenses easier becauseâ€¦ honestly, Iâ€™m lazy ðŸ˜…. I wanted a tool that keeps track of my **eat-out habits, travel expenses, and subscriptions**, all in one place, with a clean and minimalist interface.  

Itâ€™s also my first real dabble in **frontend development**, so expect some pastel vibes and a Pinterest-ish layout ðŸ˜Ž.
